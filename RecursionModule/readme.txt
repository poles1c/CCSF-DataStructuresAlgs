Module 7 Recursion Homework

Coding Questions

1) Write a recursive void method that reverses the contents of an array. Do not create a new array- reverse the contents of the current array. (Note the void return type.)

My answer can be found in the HomeworkM7Driver.java file. The method name is arrayReverse.

2) Write a recursive method to determine whether a String contains a 'q' not immediately followed by a 'u' (ignoring capitalization). In other words:
  the word does contain at least one 'q'
  and that q is followed by anything except a 'u'

My answer can be found in the HomeworkM7Driver.java file​. The method name is qNotFollowedByU​ and the helper method name is qNotFollowedByUHelper.

3) Rewrite the getOccurrencesOf method in the LinkedMultiset class using recursion. The original, non-recursive version is shown below for reference.​ For full credit, do not convert to an array or use another data structure. Directly use the node chain.
​
My answer can be found in the LinkedMultiset.java file. The method name is getOccurrencesOfHelper.
